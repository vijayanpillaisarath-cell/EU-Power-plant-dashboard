Project Documentation
European Conventional Power Plant Analysis

1.	Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the conventional power generation landscape across Europe using Power BI and excel.

2.	Tools Used
-	Microsoft Excel

-	Power BI

3.	Dataset
-	Source: Open Power System Data (Conventional Power Plants EU)

-	Data contains: Power_Plant_Name, Country, Capacity (MW), Energy_source, Technology, Commissioned Year, and Geographic Coordinates (Lat/Long)

4.	Steps Followed
-	Cleaned data in Excel (e.g., removed blanks, formatted columns)

-	Used Excel formulas and Pivot Tables for basic analysis

-	Imported cleaned data into Power BI

-	Built dashboards using charts, slicers, and KPIs

5.	Key Insights
-	Dominant Energy Sources: Fossil fuels (specifically Natural Gas and Hard Coal) still represent a significant portion of the total count of conventional plants.
-	Capacity Leaders: Large-scale capacity is concentrated in industrial hubs like Germany and France (especially Nuclear in France).
-	Technology Trends: Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) show higher efficiency and prevalence in newer commissioned plants compared to older Steam Turbines.
-	Geographic Clustering: Power plants are heavily clustered near water bodies (for cooling) and major industrial zones.

Examples of Key Insights:

•	Germany and Italy are major hubs for conventional power, with high concentrations of both fossil fuel and renewable energy plants.


•	Germany leads the dataset in sheer volume of facilities, accounting for over 1,200 individual power units, with a total capacity exceeding 80,000
